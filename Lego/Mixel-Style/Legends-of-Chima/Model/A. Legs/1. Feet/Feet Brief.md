## The Loser City community has beef with you, kind stranger
- Someone had reposted some of your content on reddit - REDDIT POST and Original Loona Model
- People have been reporting that its difficult to get instructions off of you.
- However, I think the originally referenced account may have been hacked account.
- Since the guy was uncooperative, I cloned your MOC
- I think I found you on twitter
	- Not even entirely sure if twitter guy is the real you.
